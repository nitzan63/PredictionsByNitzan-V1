a. loadXmlFile(String path): This method will be used to handle the "Load XML File" command. It takes the file path as a parameter.

b. EntitiesDefinitionDTO getEntitiesDefinition(): This method will handle the "Display Simulation Details" command for entity definitions.

c. List<RuleDTO> getRules(): This method will handle the "Display Simulation Details" command for rules.

d. TerminationDTO getTermination(): This method will handle the "Display Simulation Details" command for termination conditions.

e. EnvironmentDTO getEnvironmentProperties(): This method will handle the "Run Simulation" command, specifically for getting environment properties.

f. void setEnvironmentProperties(UserEnvironmentInputDTO input): This method will be used to set the environment properties as specified by the user.

g. SimulationRunMetadataDTO runSimulation(): This method will handle the "Run Simulation" command and initiate the simulation run.

h. List<SimulationRunMetadataDTO> getSimulationRuns(): This method will handle the "Display Simulation Results" command for listing previous runs.

i. SimulationRunResultsDTO getSimulationResults(String runIdentifier): This method will handle the "Display Simulation Results" command for a specific simulation run.

j. void exit(): This method will handle the "Exit Program" command.

Please note that this is just a high-level design. The actual implementation might require additional methods or modifications to the ones listed here.
