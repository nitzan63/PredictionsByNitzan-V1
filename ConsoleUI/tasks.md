# Steps to implement the UI!

Create a Main Class: 📜 This will serve as the entry point for your application. Create a main method and, within it, display the welcome message and the list of available commands.

Display Command Menu: 📝 Create a method to display the list of available commands. It will look something like this:

plaintext
Copy code
Welcome to the Simulation Engine! Please select a command:
1. Load XML File
2. Display Simulation Details
3. Run Simulation
4. Display Simulation Results
5. Exit Program
   Handle User Input: 🎮 Get the user's input and validate it (make sure it's a valid command). You can use Java's Scanner class to read the input. After validating, direct the input to the corresponding method to execute the selected command.

Execute Commands: 🛠️ For each command, call the corresponding method in the DTO layer through the DTO-UI interface, which you have already implemented. Then, process the user's input and execute the command.

Display Output: 🖥️ Present the result in a user-friendly format, and handle any errors or exceptions that may occur. Be sure to provide helpful messages for the user.

Loop: 🔁 After each command execution, display the command menu again and wait for the user's next input. Repeat until the user selects the "Exit Program" command.

Exit: 🚪 When the user selects the "Exit Program" command, display a farewell message and close the application.


## packages and classes to implement:

In the `ConsoleUI` module, you might need a few classes to organize the code and provide a clean user interface. Below is a suggested package organization and classes within each package:

1. `main` package:
    - `SimulationCLI` (the main class with the entry point of the application)

2. `commands` package (classes responsible for handling user commands):
    - `LoadXMLCommand` (handles the command for loading XML files)
    - `DisplaySimulationDetailsCommand` (handles the command for displaying simulation details)
    - `RunSimulationCommand` (handles the command for running the simulation)
    - `DisplaySimulationResultsCommand` (handles the command for displaying simulation results)
    - `ExitProgramCommand` (handles the command for exiting the program)

3. `input` package (classes responsible for handling user input):
    - `UserInputHandler` (processes user input and returns the chosen command)

4. `output` package (classes responsible for displaying output to the user):
    - `MenuDisplay` (displays the command menu)
    - `OutputFormatter` (formats the output data for display)
    - `OutputPrinter` (prints the formatted output to the console)

5. `exceptions` package (classes for custom exceptions related to the UI):
    - `InvalidCommandException` (thrown when the user provides an invalid command)

Feel free to customize this package organization based on your specific implementation. Start by creating the `SimulationCLI` class and then work your way through the classes listed above as you build the CLI interface step-by-step. Don't worry about creating all the classes at once; it's more important to gradually build up the functionality. 🛠️📈
